### Hi there 

My name is Gabriel NÃ©ris, but you can go foward to call me Golden Boy;

I'm a Game Programmer, Web Designer and Cat/Pudding Lover sometimes, which is kinda weird to say;

Even thought, i'm just a starter, so there's many things that I have to reach yet;

Be cool and stay tuned to my new contents on my github

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Air Rage - My Personal Site
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Javascript - Game Programming (Gamemaker, Godot, Unity)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Indie Studios (Still thinking on that)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Anyone who knows more than me
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Go to my house (Jokin' Twitter: https://twitter.com/GoldenBlockReal)
- âš¡ Fun fact: We live beacuse the world needs us
